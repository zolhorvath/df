#    Given I am logged in as a user with the "administrator" role
#    And article content:
#      | title      | moderation_state |
#      | My Content | published        |
#    And landing_page content:
#      | title  | path    | moderation_state |

#    When I go to "/foobar"
#    And I embed the content "My Content" in the "middle" region

#    And I wait for ajax to finish
#    Then the response should contain "My Content"
