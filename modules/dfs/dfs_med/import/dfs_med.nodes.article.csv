40AF8E9F-BADD-48F3-AFE0-ADCFA9169F37,Summer of Classic TV,classic-tv.jpg,"<p>This summer instead of seeing the new blockbuster hit I decided to catch up on the shows of a time in which CGI and special effects were unheard of. Shows like <em>The Beverly Hillbillies</em> and <em>The Lone Ranger</em> gave me a sense of humility that cannot be found in today’s TV series. The simple camera shots and practiced line memorization lead me to smile when I compared them with todays TV series. Shows such as <em>The Andy Griffith Show</em> or <em>Bat Masterson</em> helped me appreciate where the actors of today came from. Often forgotten, old television series such as the ones found here, show a time in which life was much more simple and gives people a sense of nostalgia that other television shows simply cannot.</p><p>I took a ride through Beverly Hills and saw the way rich people live with Jed Clampett and the rest of his hillbilly family. And I saw Bat Masterson ride through the wild west wooing women and getting into trouble while simultaneously watching Sheriff Andy Taylor wreak havoc within the moonshining community. Each show portrayed a completely different scenario in which I was able to jump right in to. Better than today’s shows such as Law and Order or anything you will find on TBS, these older shows made every single episode interesting with vastly different plots and competing personalities. </p><p>Before paying $15 at your local movie theater, or wasting your time with shows that are uninteresting or stale I suggest tuning in to these older shows this summer to give you a great viewing experience, to save you some money, and to give you a perspective on television that is nearly forgotten.</p>","Summer of Classic TV, Enjoy Classic TV this Summer",Family

These classic television shows can cater any of those needs, and a number of others too.</p><p>Ranked within the top 50 greatest TV shows of all time, <em>Bonanza</em> follows the lives of the Cartwright family, who live on a 500,000 acre ranch. What is interesting about this show is that it deals less with the problems that arise on the ranch, and instead deals with the interactions between the members of the Cartwright family.</p><p>A sitcom spanning nearly the whole decade of the 60’s and ranked as the 9th best show in television history, <em>The Andy Griffith Show</em> followed the life and times of Andy, his friends, and his family. It takes place in a fictional town called Mayberry, North Carolina. A comedy, it runs nearly 8 seasons, more than half in black and white, Andy portrays a man who brings out of town criminals and local moonshiners to justice.</p><p>The classic comedy, <em>The Beverly Hillbillies</em> shows the Clampett family as they live with an enormous sum of wealth that they came upon through striking oil on their humdrum farm. The show describes the life and times of this family as they travel to Beverly Hills, Washington, and even New York City and shows how out of touch with the wealthy they actually are.</p><p>A Western, The Lone Ranger was the highest rated show on ABC in the early 50’s. The premise comprises of the “lone” Texas Ranger after all the others were killed and he takes on the responsibility of wandering through the west and bringing the existing criminals to justice.</p>","Tuned In: A guide to the classics, Tune in to the Classics",Action-Adventure
