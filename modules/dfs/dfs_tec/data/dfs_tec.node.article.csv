In having a purpose, the most important aspect is creating something powerful and meaningful.</p><h2>Boundaries</h2><p>In order to be successful, you need to set boundaries. You need to learn that you cannot please everyone that surrounds you. If the scope of your business is too small, you will quickly fade.

Setting a common ground gives employees the opportunity to understand what is trying to be accomplished. This helps employees collaborate together, instead of having individuals work on unnecessary tasks. Goals are supposed to be challenging to encourage employees innovate together and setting higher standards for themselves and the company.</p><p>Having a purpose, setting boundaries, and establishing goals are highlighted qualities in planning for success.

Planning for success is the pathway to exceed significantly.</p>",doctype-hi-res.jpg,"business,success,finance,startup",/content/planning-for-your-success
The Lost Art of Creativity,"<p>Being a creative individual means being unique, taking risks, having curiosity, and generating new ideas. Everyday our lives are filled with creative moments, as long as we are unguarded to new opportunities. The lost art of creativity encompasses the thought of how people perceive that creativeness is a mysterious quality that other people have. On the other hand, every single person has the capability to reach into his or her creative side.</p><blockquote>Create your own visual style…let it be unique for yourself and yet identifiable for others<br /><span>-Orson Welles</span></blockquote><p>To be unique, means being memorable. Being unique makes you and your business noticeable and keeps everyone’s lives interesting. Too often in life we worry about being like everyone else.  Instead of worrying about being like the rest of the world, think outside of the box on how to be the best version of you and making yourself differential from others. This is crucial in the business world. Creativity in the business world leads to innovation from using employee’s talents and imaginative ideas.</p><p>Risk taking the absolute fundamental in being creative. The fine art of risk taking is being uncertain and unpredictable. Taking risks is rewarding (even though it does not sound like it)!  Risk allows you and your business to open new windows to opportunities.  Developing new strengths, talents, allows you to evolve and discover new aspects on life and the world. Furthermore, in taking chances, makes you feel more proactive in making things happen, rather than waiting and watching for them to happen.</p><p>Having curiosity cultivates the creative mind. Curiosity is the fuel to your creativity. If you are bored and uninterested in a project that you are working on, ask your self, “What would I do differently if I were to give this project to another co-worker?” or, “Who can I consult with to make this project more inspiring and meaningful to me?”  Curiosity provokes imagination and self- motivation. People who are curious develop themselves, which leads to discovery and invention.</p><p>From discovery and innovation, leads to generating new ideas. Having a “creative block” is normal when there is a lack of constructing new ideas, however, everyone is creative in different ways.  Best results of idea generation include group and individual brainstorming. The key to creative thinking includes positive emotions, ridiculous (but realistic) ideas, and no criticism of any kind. Divergent thinking is an encouragement in order to achieve the success in brainstorming new ideas.</p><p>Uniqueness, risk taking, curiosity, and idea generation is the route to creativity. The end result of creative thoughts is always resourceful and original to solve problems or revolutionize a business.</p>",create.jpg,"design,focus,creativity",/content/the-lost-art-of-creativity
Scalable Personalization,"<p>From marketing standpoint, personalization is crucial in being identifiable while doing business. Customization allows assist businesses stay ahead of their competition while having insight on other competitor’s products. One way businesses build and improve personalization is from customer engagement. Personalization includes segmenting, targeting, and positioning (S.T.P of marketing).</p><p>For an example, data helps a business segment customers. Let’s say your business sends an email to clienteles (assuming that they have read the content) your company should not continue to shove the same information from the email when they visit your website. It would make better sense to present a different piece of material related to the email to help the customer navigate his or her way through the website. Since, your company is tracking the customer’s engagement via email, your company can better personalize your website for the customer’s needs to make a satisfying web experience. An important part of segmentation includes demographics, customer behavior, and customer lifestyle.</p><p>After segmenting your customers, your business can decide what group of customers you want to target, and position your solutions to their wants or needs. By targeting your audience, this makes sending your message out to your customers out easier, rather than sending irrelevance to people that do not need your service. Promotions and discounts is a classic marketing method for targeting customers. For instance, no one likes receiving a coupon for a shirt that they had already purchased. Suggesting a matching sweater or tie, is a more of a strategic process to target the same customer. Use the knowledge from customers to apply it to upcoming offers.</p><p>Once the target audience is confirmed, deciding how to identify their products to customers comes next. Positioning relates to strategy in carrying out marketing and business objectives. Furthermore, positioning yourself as a company and your products leads to an increase sales growth and recognition from your brand. Though, making sure your customer’s needs is not enough, your customers should believe what your products, services, and competitors provide. In simpler words, understanding whom your product is for, value of product, and differentiation from customers is basically the main points in positioning.</p><p>When it comes to personalization for your company, segmenting, targeting, and positioning are the essential points for marketing your products and firm. In segmenting your customers, you can identify your customer needs. Targeting consists of concentrating on what segment of the market you want to sell your products to. Lastly, positioning your company sets significance to your products and services, and differentiating those products and services from other companies. Following these three factors will lead to personalization, and also growth within your business.</p>",scalable.jpg,"personalization,targeting,marketing,scale",/content/scalable-personalization
